"""Verify that every relative Markdown link in this repository's documentation
resolves to a file that exists.

Nine links to a `doc/roles/hover.md` that was never written sat unnoticed
across the role documents, the knowledge index and AGENTS.md's repository map,
including one that told the reader to "**read this**". A link to a missing
document is worse than no link: it asserts the answer exists somewhere.

Scope: `*.md` under the directories in DIRS, plus the repository-root
instruction files. Absolute URLs, anchors and mailto: links are skipped;
anchors on a relative link are stripped before resolving, so `foo.md#bar`
checks `foo.md`.

Exit 0 when every link resolves, 1 otherwise. Run it before finishing any
documentation change.
