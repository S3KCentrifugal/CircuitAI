TRANSPORT FERRY

A donated T2 constructor used to walk to its new owner: 410-470 metal of
unescorted builder crossing a contested map. This flies it instead.

The protocol is three messages over AiSendMessage, the channel the roster
already uses. It is deliberately not ai.CallUI - that is a one-way mirror to
the local LuaUI for display and never reaches another AI, so it cannot carry
coordination.

    barbferry|req|<x>|<z>     TECH -> all, when it starts its first T2 lab.
                              Carries TECH's base position so AIR need not
                              have seen TECH's roster line yet.
    barbferry|ack             AIR  -> TECH, "I am building one for you".
    barbferry|give|<unitId>   AIR  -> TECH, "it is over your base and yours".

Sequence, in the order the units actually move:

  1. a teammate wants a transport   -> broadcast req. Any role may call
                                       RequestTransport(); TECH does so on its
                                       own once its metal income clears
                                       RequestMinMetalIncome and it owns no
                                       transport, and again after
                                       RequestCooldownSeconds if that is still
                                       true (the transport died, or AIR was busy)
  2. AIR takes the request          -> the next air factory task is a
                                       transport, ahead of everything else
  3. transport finishes             -> AIR flies it to TECH's base itself,
                                       still owning it, so the hand-over
                                       happens where TECH wants the unit
  4. transport arrives              -> ai.GiveUnits to TECH, send give
  5. TECH receives it               -> CFerryTask holds it at TECH's base and
                                       it is never an army unit, because
                                       ROLE_TYPE(TRANS) now maps to FERRY in
                                       CMilitaryManager::DefaultMakeTask
  6. TECH donates a constructor     -> ferry.SetCargo(unit, recipient base):
                                       pick up, fly, drop
  7. the drop lands                 -> TECH gives the constructor to the
                                       recipient and the transport flies home

Every failure path falls back to the old behaviour - give the constructor and
let it walk - so a ferry that cannot be built, is shot down, or fails to lift
its cargo costs time, never the donation.

TRANSPORT CAP. Every transport def is capped at 0 for every role, from the
first tick. A transport with a role entry in behaviour.json is, to the native
recruiter, just another air unit, and it built extras that then sat idle with
nothing to carry. AIR raises the def it owes to owned+1 for exactly as long as
a request is open, so the ferry's explicit Recruit is the only order that can
ever produce one.
