# Playtest: local simulations

For optimization work, apply the
[performance contracts](../../../rjm.bar.docs/projects/circuitai/performance/engineering-guide.md) and
use the [test definition index](../../../rjm.bar.docs/projects/circuitai/testing/README.md). Compare pinned
old/new inputs in serial games; changing populations or concurrent games cannot
establish a CPU/FPS gain. Keep raw verdicts, distinguish per-unit engine orders
from Lua orders and network packets, and report compilation failures separately
from played behavior. A static script API check does not compile all object
methods; the actual embedded VM load remains mandatory.

For ranged-query changes, run `tools/run_ranged_performance_tests.sh`, then
rendered fixtures with `CIRCUIT_VERIFY_RANGED_QUERIES=1` and
`CIRCUIT_VERIFY_RANGED_SNAPSHOT=1`. Both variables must be absent for timing;
the oracles intentionally repeat expensive legacy work. The ranged runner
records their presence in its pins. Compare the inclusive ranged-snapshot
parent after D-221's child phases were added; `full-match-summary-v2.json`
retains both inclusive and exclusive tables without overwriting v1 evidence.
Natural games with different surviving populations are integration evidence,
not exact same-state FPS comparisons. Keep camera/focus and speed-window limits
visible in the report. Do not close an upstream engine bottleneck because an
AI-only component benchmark improved.

For D-243 routes/economy, run the native differential suite and separate games
with `CIRCUIT_VERIFY_POINT_ROUTES=1`, `CIRCUIT_VERIFY_ECONOMY_INDEX=1` and staged
`Sea::VerifyPowerIndex=true`. The full-match runner's `--verify-indexes` enables
these and marks timings invalid. All three must be disabled for timing. Pin
the pre-change dirty-tree snapshot, not just HEAD. Keep the original failed
verdict when Glacial hits known TECH invariants, even if new index checks pass.
Use `sea-route-transit` for physical formation arrival and command comparisons;
it supplies a route and is not autonomous combat evidence. Same-seed large-fleet
outcomes can vary on the baseline, so casualties alone do not prove an exact
optimization changed tactics. Record the compaction setting and build identity.

Tool: `tools/playtest/playtest.py` (reference: `tools/playtest/README.md`).
It stages a DLL plus the repo's `data/` as `BARbTest/test` into its own
engine write dir, never the install, and stops only its own engine.
Widgets: [references/widgets.md](../../../rjm.bar.docs/projects/circuitai/skills/playtest/references/widgets.md). Reading logs and
crashes: [`skills/troubleshoot-bar-logs/SKILL.md`](../troubleshoot-bar-logs/SKILL.md)
(and `skills/ai-not-moving` when commanders stand still: apply it to
`<dir>/runs/<stamp>/infolog.txt`, prefix `Skirmish AI <BARb playtest-test>`;
a compile failure shows as `being removed from team 0` at f=59).

## 1. Pin the build

Retain build logs, symbols, data/source snapshots and validation output in the
external benchmark checkout, not the source tree. Resolve the location with
`python tools/playtest/benchmark_store.py validation` (honors
`CIRCUIT_BENCHMARK_REPO`), then use a named session directory beneath it as the
scratchpad below. A missing benchmark checkout is an error, not permission to
recreate local `build-validation/`. Test source and reusable runners stay here;
disposable native-test scratch may use the OS temporary directory.

First publish every completed build to the mandatory output
`C:\bardev\bar-RecoilEngine\build-amd64-windows\install\AI\Skirmish\BARb\stable`:
stripped DLL, matching debug symbols, and current `data/` contents together.
Verify API parity against that output. Scratch binaries and playtest staging
do not substitute for updating this directory; it is not the live game install.

After the build log's own `exit 0` (never before: a mid-build DLL is partial):
```bash
S=<session scratchpad dir>
D=/c/bardev/bar-RecoilEngine/build-amd64-windows/install/AI/Skirmish/BARb/stable
mkdir -p $S/builds/bNN && cp $D/SkirmishAI.dll $D/SkirmishAI.dbg $S/builds/bNN/
```
- Pass `--dll $S/builds/bNN/SkirmishAI.dll`. The default `--dll` is that
  install folder, which the next build rewrites in place.
- The `.dbg` must match the exact DLL, or crash frames symbolise wrongly.
- `--dll` is paired with the repo's *current* `data/`. For an older DLL,
  pass `--data <snapshot of data/ from its commit>`.
- `python tools/knowledge/check_script_api.py --dll <dll>` checks that the DLL
  registers everything the script uses.

## 2. Compile check first (after any script edit)

AngelScript compiles only when a game loads, and warnings are fatal. A
failure leaves every AI idle for the whole game.
```bash
python tools/playtest/playtest.py run --dir C:/bardev/barb-playtest-sim1 --dll <dll> \
  --roles TECH --headless --shots "" --speed 20 --minutes 1 --wall-minutes 6 --keep-going
grep -a ': ERR \+:\|: WARN :\|Lib exception\|SCRIPT CRASH' C:/bardev/barb-playtest-sim1/infolog.txt
grep -ac 'rules loaded' C:/bardev/barb-playtest-sim1/infolog.txt   # = the number of TECH AIs
```
- Ignore `(0, 0) : ERR  : Object {N}. GC cannot destroy` and `(0, 0) : WARN :
  There is an external reference`: that is teardown after
  `EOH::DestroySkirmishAI`.
- A real error names a `.as (row, col)`.
- `python tools/knowledge/check_script_api.py` catches unbound members, not
  unbound globals.

Recurring AngelScript errors:
- `in` and `out` are reserved words;
- there is no `max`/`min` or `SQUARE`: use `AiMax`/`AiMin` (int, float,
  AIFloat3) and `SQUARE_SIZE`;
- a handle assignment needs `@t = ...`;
- a bare `{...}` is not an argument: write `array<float> = {...}`;
- a `const CCircuitDef@` cannot be passed as `CCircuitDef@`;
- shadowed names and uninitialised locals are errors.

## 3. Launch

For new experiments follow [storage conventions](../../../rjm.bar.docs/projects/circuitai/test-storage.md).
AIR arenas and scorecard runs allocate a unique categorized write directory
when `--dir` is omitted. For the generic runner or a specialised preparer,
allocate one first and pass the returned path to every stage/run/watch/stop:

```bash
GAME_DIR=$(python tools/playtest/storage.py allocate --domain tech --area economy --scenario rush-afus --map supreme --kind benchmark)
```

Cases and checks are organized by domain and area. Legacy short check names
still work. Keep the printed `runs/<UTC-id>/` archive path, publish compact
evidence with `storage.py publish <archive> --screenshot <filename.png>`, and
rebuild discovery with `storage.py index`. Never delete old raw evidence or
rewrite an old verdict to make the benchmark pass. The explicit legacy paths
below remain supported for reproducing old commands.

```bash
python tools/playtest/playtest.py stop --dir C:/bardev/barb-playtest-simN   # always, first
python tools/playtest/playtest.py run --dir C:/bardev/barb-playtest-simN --dll <dll> \
  --map "Supreme Isthmus v1.7" --roles TECH --side legion \
  --speed 20 --minutes 45 --wall-minutes 60 --keep-going --headless --shots ""
```

**Running it**
- Run with Bash `run_in_background: true`. Wait for `[playtest] report: <path>`
  in its output, and take the run folder from that line, not from
  `ls runs | tail`.
- Killing the watcher (a timeout, TaskStop) leaves `spring.exe` running and
  writes no report. Re-attach with `playtest.py watch --dir <dir> --checks <same>
  --minutes <same> --keep-going --wall-minutes <N>` (`--no-stop` to only
  observe; without these it re-reads the log from the start and stops the
  game at once), or `stop`.
- To follow a live game, Monitor `tail -n0 -F <dir>/infolog.txt | grep -a
  --line-buffered -E '<tags>|Access violation|SCRIPT CRASH'` (no `( ... &)`
  wrapper; timeout 1800000, re-arm when it expires).
- Right after a launch, `<dir>/infolog.txt` is still the previous game's log,
  until `[playtest] engine pid` appears. TaskStop old watchers before
  relaunching on a dir.

**Parallel games**
- One `--dir C:/bardev/barb-playtest-simN` per concurrent game, and the same
  `--dir` for run, watch and stop.
- A second `run` on a live dir fails with `PermissionError` on the staged
  DLL, or with `ERROR: a playtest engine is already running`. Check the output
  for `ERROR:`, not only the exit code.

**Flags that matter**
- `--keep-going` for anything exploratory or long. Every checks file forbids
  `[INVARIANT]`, and the default `--checks tech_opening` expects
  `[Rule] opening.mex`, which today's TECH never logs, so without it the run
  stops early.
- `--wall-minutes` always. The default (stop_minute x 1.5 + 4) cuts off slow
  16-AI or windowed games without saying so.
- `--roles TECH`: a fast TECH-vs-TECH 1v1. `--roles all` (the default) is 16
  AIs at about 1-2x whatever `--speed` says.
- `--others none` drops only the ally-side AIs; the enemies for each role
  still spawn. To avoid a TECH enemy, whose nuke often wipes team 0 at 23 to
  27 min, move its spot to the ally side (Supreme: `--ally-spots
  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10`, not yet played) and check the `teams:` line in
  report.md.
- `--ai-option profile=<name>` picks the profile (default
  `experimental_balanced`, for every AI, prod too).
- For a game the owner watches: `--shots "" --no-stop --speed 1 --minutes 90
  --extra-widget tools/widgets/gui_barb_team_link.lua`. It still quits at
  minutes + 0.5; the owner is a spectator (sets roles, commands nothing) and
  must reopen the BARb window.

**Map, game, teams**
- The map, game and every modoption come from the lobby's last
  `_script.txt`: pin them with `--map`, `--game`, `--modoption`.
- `--map` must be the archive's internal name ("Supreme Isthmus v1.7", "All
  That Glitters v2.2.3", "Glacial Gap v1.1", "Tundra Continents v2.3.1").
  Otherwise the engine dies about 8 s in with `Dependent archive ... not
  found`. Look names up in `<dir>/cache/ArchiveCache*.lua`, and pass
  `--map-file data/script/src/maps/<file>.as` when the name does not reduce
  to one.
- Team 0 is always the AI under test (`--role`, `--side`). The spectating host
  is its own team at (64, 64) in ally team 2. Gaia is the last team.
- Team 0 starts on the map file's StartSpot, not where the owner started:
  compare `[Playtest] frame 1 team 0 ... start (x, z)` before claiming a
  repro (D-116: 77 elmos moved the lab).

**Settings**
- `--set KEY=VAL` edits only `Global::RoleSettings::Tech` int/float/bool/string
  lines in the staged `global.as`, pasted as literal AngelScript. Quote
  strings: `--set 'RushObjective="afus"'`.
- Settings that `data/config/*.json` overrides (all of `weapons.json` and
  `lanes.json`) need `--data <edited copy of data/>`. TECH rewrites
  `MaxT1Builders`, `MaxT2BotLabs` and `Minimum*ConstructorBots` at runtime, so
  `--set` on them does nothing.

## 4. Fast-forward

| Game | Game min per wall min (load 30-60 s extra) |
| --- | --- |
| 1v1 headless, `--speed 20` to `40` | about 8 to 16x |
| 1v1 windowed | lower, GPU-bound |
| 16 AIs | about 1 to 2x |

- `--speed` defaults to **1**: always pass it.
- `--speed-plan "20:20,34.6:1,36:20"` (minute:speed): 1x only where you watch.
  - Make the first entry equal `--speed`: a `0:X` entry lower than it is
    ignored at the start and then makes the first 1x window run at X.
  - Confirm the real rate with `grep -a "Speed set to" <dir>/infolog.txt`;
    the widget's `[Playtest] speed` line is only the request.
- `--slow-near-shots` means 1x from 0.3 min before each shot until 0.05 after.
  Shots closer than 0.5 min apart break it: use one `--speed-plan` window
  instead.
- AI map drawings (the intro, lanes, smileys) are paced in **real time**,
  while their holds are in game frames. Run at 1x across any drawing a shot or
  check depends on, and take the window from the `[Commands] map drawing`,
  `[Lanes] drawn` and `[Lanes] erased` frames of a previous run.
- A short fast check never sees a drawing finish.
- The intro rolls the credits in 5% of games, which delays everything after it.
- In a widget, send `setmaxspeed S`, `setminspeed S`, `setmaxspeed S`: that
  works in both directions (the engine keeps max at least min, and
  `GetGameSpeed` is stale until `Speed set to` arrives).

## 5. Screenshots (windowed only)

- Headless writes blank 187-byte PNGs but still logs `[Playtest] screenshot`.
  Omit `--headless` and check that PNGs are about 2-3 MB.
- `--shots "35@3200@3900:7200,35.3@14000@6144:6144"`: minute@height@x:z.
  - Without x:z the camera frames team 0's start.
  - `@14000@6144:6144` shows all of Supreme Isthmus.
  - `--shots ""` turns the camera off, when a widget drives its own.
  - The default is `1,3,6,10`.
  - An x:z shot echoes `at (-1, -1)`: ignore it.
- Aim at positions from the log (cluster, `RESERVE:`, choke lines), and time
  shots from a previous run's frames, at 1x.
- PNGs are `screen_<UTC time>.png`. Map them to game time by order against the
  `[Playtest] screenshot at X min` lines, or by the `[CBitmap::Save] saved`
  line's `[f=N]`.
- While live, read `<dir>/screenshots/`; afterwards `runs/<stamp>/`. Launch
  deletes the old ones.
- The host is a spectator (`specfullview`): shots show every team, and the
  AI's map strokes render white.
- The windowed game is live: tell the user not to click it. `requested by
  widget` or `Speed set to` lines they cause are user input.
- Inspect screenshots with the available image viewer and include the useful ones in updates to the user.

## 6. Widgets

Stage test widgets with `--extra-widget tools/playtest/widgets/<file>.lua`
(repeatable) on **every** run: staging deletes the dir's widgets.

Existing ones:

| Widget | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `team_stats.lua` | [TeamStats] |
| `unit_census.lua` | [Census] |
| `build_area.lua` | [BuildArea], then `build_area.py` |
| `smiley_watch.lua` | full LOS at minute 20, screenshots each AI drawing |
| `gantry_watch.lua` | watches the gantry |
| `intro_test.lua` | intro timing |
| `draw_test.lua` | draws a test map drawing |
| `role_swap_test.lua` | switches roles |

Writing one: [references/widgets.md](../../../rjm.bar.docs/projects/circuitai/skills/playtest/references/widgets.md).

## 7. Judge and read

1. `<dir>/report.md` (`--print-report` prints it all): verdict, checks,
   timeline.
   - `skirmish AI None` means team 0 was never identified, so every AI-scoped
     check silently missed. Look for a compile failure or a `--role` mismatch.
   - The reason is only the category of the last failure; read `## Failures`
     for each one. It never names a crash.
   - `script errors` whose lines are all `(0, 0) : ERR  : Object {N}. GC
     cannot destroy` is an AI destroyed mid-game (a team wiped, a crash), not a
     compile error: find why with the greps below and `EOH::DestroySkirmishAI`.
2. Always grep the run's log:
   ```bash
   L=<dir>/runs/<stamp>/infolog.txt
   grep -a -c 'Access violation\|has crashed\|Fatal:' $L
   grep -a ': ERR \+:\|Lib exception\|failed handling event\|SCRIPT CRASH' $L | sort -u | head
   grep -a '\[INVARIANT\]' $L | sed 's/.*\[INVARIANT\] //' | cut -c1-8 | sort | uniq -c
   ```
3. Everything deeper (size discipline, markers, symbolising
   `SkirmishAI.dll [0x...]`) is in `skills/troubleshoot-bar-logs`. Playtest
   specifics:
   - **Symbols:** match the build by `staged.json`'s `dll_sha256_16` against
     `sha256sum builds/bNN/SkirmishAI.dll | cut -c1-16`, and symbolise with that
     `builds/bNN` `.dbg`: the staged one can be stale.
   - **Where:** live `<dir>/infolog.txt` (deleted at each launch); one game
     per `runs/<stamp>/infolog.txt`; the staged build in `<dir>/staged.json`.
   - **AI lines:** `Skirmish AI <BARb playtest-test>: :::AI LOG:S:<ai>:T:<team>:F:<frame>:L::<text>`.
     Filter one team with `grep -a ':::AI LOG:S:[0-9]*:T:0:'`.
   - **Native lines** (`EXP:`, `RESERVE:`, `LANES:`, `NUKE:`...) carry no
     team, so in a 1v1 both AIs interleave. Tell them apart by faction prefix
     or coordinates. (`--others prod` is ambiguous: three install folders
     share `SMRTBARb/stable`, and `using dir` names the wrong one.)
   - **Noise** to ignore: `AdvSky`, `corfast_dead`, `gui_pip ... CreateShader`,
     `Failed to load: tf_*.lua`, `Game-side script ... is missing`.
   - **Size:** logs reach 25 MB. Use `grep -c`, `-m`, `head`; never read a
     whole infolog.

## 8. Stop and clean up

- `python tools/playtest/playtest.py stop --dir <dir>` only.
  - It kills engines whose command line has that exact `--write-dir`, plus
    `<dir>/playtest.pid`.
  - A stale pid file can name an unrelated process: check it with
    `tasklist //FI "PID eq N"` first.
- Never `taskkill /IM spring.exe`: the user may be playing. Check with
  `tasklist //FI "IMAGENAME eq spring.exe"`, and read each engine's
  `--write-dir` via `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`.
- A windowed engine that crashed stays alive in its crash handler: the
  progress frame stops advancing. `tail -c 1500 <dir>/infolog.txt`, then stop.
- `[QuitAction] user exited to system` after `[Playtest] end at ... quitting`
  is the widget's own quit.

## Checks files, benchmarks

- `tools/playtest/checks/<name>.json`: `expect` (`key`, `pattern`,
  `by_minute`, `after_key`, `scope`), `forbid` (`key`, `pattern`,
  `after_minute`), `pass_on` (`key`, `pattern`), `stop_minute`. A missing
  `key` crashes watch: no report, and the engine is left running.
  - `expect` and `pass_on` default to scope `tech` (team 0's AI text after
    `:L::`). Widget and native lines need `"scope": "any"`.
  - `pass_on` only sets PASS; the game still plays on.
  - Keep a forbid on `: ERR\s+:` and one containing `INVARIANT`: the
    `check_invariants.py` tool requires it.
- Rush benchmarks: `SPEED=8 NOTE=... bash tools/playtest/bench_loop.sh t2 afus`
  (`DLL=` and `DIR=` pick the build and dir). It records each run itself;
  `benchmark.py record <run> --objective X` is only for a run launched by
  hand. Confirm a benchmark result once at `--speed 1`.

## Windows and Git Bash traps

- In a grep bracket, `[^\r]` excludes backslash and the letter r. Infologs are
  LF: use `.\{0,N\}` (or `grep -E '.{0,N}'`).
- `S:[0-9]:` misses AI ids 10-15: use `S:[0-9]*:`.
- Use `tail -n 3`: `tail -3 f1 f2` fails.
- Use `tasklist //FI`: a single slash gets path-mangled.
- Patch through a script file (heredocs mangle backslashes; files are CRLF),
  and chain the run after it with `&&`.
- Set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` for non-ASCII output.
- Never write under the BAR install.
